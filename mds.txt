	Intel worked with kernel community much better than before
		Still much room for improvement
		Debian was not brought in until days before release.
	Major performance hit on all Intel systems
	syscalls are now expensive

	Users now have to choose between security and performance
	What decision did your cloud provider choose?

Coordinated hardware security issues still underway, no end in sight.
