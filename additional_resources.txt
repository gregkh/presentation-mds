This talk is a very simple summary of some of the Spectre issues.

To get a real understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions,
please see the below resources.  They explain it all much better than I
could do.

The first post, read this before anything else.  This is the Google
Project Zero post describing the original Spectre issues as found by
Jann Horn:


Then look at the other papers and documentation from the original web
pages created for these problems, because every cool new problem
deserves a web page and a logo.  Seriously, they do.

The Wikipedia entry goes into some prior history that led people to
discover this work, and is worth watching as it is trying to keep of the
new variants that keep getting announced:

Red Hat made a cute video that tries to explain how this all works for
those of us who do not understand how a CPU really works inside (i.e.
all of us):

XXX from Google came up with the idea of a "retpoline" to try to
mitigate the problems found for variant 2, without taking as severe of a
performance hit as everyone originally thought was going to happen.
It's a great read as well:

Intel published two good papers describing these classes of problems and
goes into some potential solutions for the issues.  These are easy
reading and not very technical, so worth sending to managers if they
have questions about these issues:

The Spectre variant 4 was found again by Jann, and described very well
in this bug report, which was pretty much the only announcement for it:
	https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528
(For an interesting note, look at comment 4 in the bug entry.)

The Linux kernel documentation about this problem, and how to modify
your kernel code to avoid it:

Miscellaneous items worth mentioning for the whole train-wreck that was
the original Spectre/Meltdown announcement that make for fun reading:
